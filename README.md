# Using Temple's OwlsNest
Temple has a High Performance Computing cluster and one specific aspect that is relevant to ourlab is the [OwlsNest](https://www.hpc.temple.edu/owlsnest2/). It will help us process our neuroimaging data much more quickly than we can do on our local resources. This resource is especially useful for the data coming in off our RF1 grant since it uses mulit-echo fMRI and benefits from `mriqc`, `fmriprep`, `qsiprep`, and `tedana`.

Eventually, we might be able to effectively use other resources tied to their GPU systems, but these systems only work for DWI analyses right now.

## What should you know already before using the OwlsNest?
Before you start playing around on the OwlsNest, you should be quite comfortable with Linux and using the command line for any tasks. You should also read through the documentation for the OwlsNest.


## Summary of basic steps
1. Copy data from the Smith Lab Linux to your work directory on the OwlsNest.
2. scripts


## Things to consider
Using the OwlsNest effectively is still a work in progress
- Memory allocation is something you have to think about.
